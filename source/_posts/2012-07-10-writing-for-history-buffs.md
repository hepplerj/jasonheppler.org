[Alexandra Lord makes the case](http://chronicle.com/article/Writing-for-History-Buffs/132755) that for professional history to thrive, historians need to be mindful of writing accessibly for a wide audience:

> If our profession is to thrive in or outside of the academy, we need to encourage and train new scholars to write accessibly. We also need to use new media to connect with the public. Fundamentally, we must provide more opportunities for graduate students to engage with the public, and we must better reward tenure-track and tenured faculty members for seeking to reach a general audience.

Advice I whole-heartedly agree with.
