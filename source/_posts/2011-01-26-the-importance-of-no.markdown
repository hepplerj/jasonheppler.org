<a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20101201/how-to-kill-a-bad-idea.html">Jason Fried</a>: "No means you have to make tough choices that aren't always obvious at the time. No can be hard, even painful; it can lead to imagining what could have been. But when you make software, it's almost always a good idea to say no more than you say yes. Over time, you'll regret saying yes more than saying no."
