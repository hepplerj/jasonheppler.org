[Ella-raye Dickens](http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/11/10/what-your-web-design-says-about-you/):

> When people ask me to describe the importance of web design - I often compare it to the front cover of a book. As with a book - you often judge the content inside on the front cover - whether you consciously intend to or not.
