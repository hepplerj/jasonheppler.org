[Ryan Cordell has put together a great collection of resources](http://ryan.cordells.us/blog/2012/09/12/useful-resources-for-the-academic-job-market/) for graduate students entering or contemplating the job market.

> Later today I’ll join a workshop for graduate students in Northeastern University’s English Graduate Program who are making (or considering) a run on the job market. As a recent survivor of the market I hope I can offer some insight into its quirks and vicissitudes. To that end—and with the help of several colleagues on Twitter—I’ve compiled a list of useful articles for students embarking on the academic job search.

Great set of resources.
