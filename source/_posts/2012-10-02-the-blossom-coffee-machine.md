[The Verge writes about an $11,000 coffee machine](http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/1/3432980/blossom-one-limited-coffee-maker-11111) constructed with exotic materials and tooled to brew the perfect cup of coffee:

> Blossom isn’t looking to steal sales from the likes of Keurig, not yet at least. Instead, the company is gunning straight for the high-end, extreme coffee enthusiast market with its Blossom One Limited brewer. The $11,111 machine is hand-made with exotic materials like mahogany and teak, and Blossom is even hand-delivering it to customers that are willing to plunk down that kind of money for a coffee maker. But while the One Limited has some exotic materials, it’s the integration of new technology with the traditional methods of making coffee that has our interest piqued.

Whoh.
