<a href="http://www.digitalsociety.org/2011/01/netflix-spends-20-times-more-on-postage-than-bandwidth/">Digital Society</a>: "It currently costs Netflix up to $1 per DVD mailed round trip while a typical streamed movie costs 5 cents. With 2 million DVDs per day being shipped, Netflix is spending $700M per year in physical disk postage and that number continues to decline as Netflix adds more streaming content."
