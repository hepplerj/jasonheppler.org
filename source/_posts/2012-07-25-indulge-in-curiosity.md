[Steve Jobs](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/10/jobs/all/1):

> "I'm a big believer in boredom," [Steve Jobs] told me. Boredom allows one to indulge in curiosity, he explained, and "out of curiosity comes everything." The man who popularized personal computers and smartphones — machines that would draw our attention like a flame attracts gnats — worried about the future of boredom. "All the [technology] stuff is wonderful, but having nothing to do can be wonderful, too."
