<a href="http://www.datelinezero.com/2011/01/29/3-projects-to-create-a-government-less-internet-and-why-its-needed/">Daniel La Ponsie writes</a> about three projects that are underway to keep government out of the Internet. Many in the political class are quite comfortable with government blocks on internet access, epitomized in a <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/06/lieberman-bill-gives-feds-emergency-powers-to-secure-civilian-net/">far-reaching proposal</a> by Senators Lieberman and Collins that could shut down civilian Internet access in the face of a "cybersecurity emergency." The three projects under development are Openet, Netsukuku, and OPENMESH.
