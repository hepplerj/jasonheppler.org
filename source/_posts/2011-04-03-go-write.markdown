[Frank Chimero](http://blog.frankchimero.com/post/4212953701/tweeting-and-writing-and-deflating-like-a-balloon): 

>Writing is chasing a question—an inquiry of the mind. Forward is better than every direction at once. It’s not really writing until you feel something; until you choke up at a thought, until you start fidgeting in your seat in excitement, until you feel the twinge of pain that happens when a thorn is pulled out of your side. Go back. Delete everything before you started fidgeting or crying or deflating like a balloon. Then, write some more. Go write.
