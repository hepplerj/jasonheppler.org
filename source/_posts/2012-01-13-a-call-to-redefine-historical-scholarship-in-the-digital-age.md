We're asking for endorsements, feedback, and edits to "[A Call to Redefine Historical Scholarship in the Digital Turn](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13D5HjjcnnAHoNaUIjwFHET83_r7kYtM0CPTYGhcMrjM/edit)," a letter that emerged from the THATcamp AHA in a session on training, tenure, and promotion. The letter will be submitted to the American Historical Association's Research Division next week.
