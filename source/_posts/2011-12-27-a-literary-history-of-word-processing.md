[Great piece in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/books/a-literary-history-of-word-processing.html) featuring the inimitable <a
href="http://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/">Matthew Kirschenbaum</a> and
the book he's working on:

> The literary history of the typewriter has its well-established milestones, from Mark Twain producing the first typewritten manuscript with "Life on the Mississippi" to Truman Capote famously dismissing Jack Kerouac’s "On the Road," pounded out on a 120-foot scroll, with the quip "That's not writing, that’s typing." 
>
> The literary history of word processing is far murkier, but that isn’t stopping Matthew G. Kirschenbaum, an associate professor of English at the University of Maryland, from trying to recover it, one casual deletion and trashed document at a time.
