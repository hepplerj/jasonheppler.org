Envy Labs has launched an impressive service called <a href="http://codeschool.com/">Code School</a> designed off their highly useful <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombie</a>s that teaches introductory Ruby on Rails programming. The service combines screencasts, in-browser coding, challenges, and interactive teaching that makes the process of learning code engaging. Paul Stamatiou has a <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/code-school-learn-by-doing">great review</a> of the service.
