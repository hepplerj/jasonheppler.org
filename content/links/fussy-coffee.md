[Nicholas Coldicutt discusses his trip to Irukaya](http://travel.cnn.com/fine-art-perfect-tokyo-coffee-684001), a coffee café in Tokyo owned by Hiroshi Kiyota. Coffee can only be ordered with a reservation, no groups can be larger than two, and anyone who uses a cell phone, smokes, or bothers Kiyota while he's making a cup of coffee is asked to leave. Makes me think of [Jiro Ono](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Dreams_of_Sushi). There's something to be said about perfecting a craft.
