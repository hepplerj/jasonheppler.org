Chapter: "The National Monument." This volume provides an accessible and authoritative overview of the scholarship that has shaped our understanding of one of the most iconic battles in the history of the American West. A chapter I contributed, co-authored with [Douglas Seefeldt](https://dougseefeldt.net/about-2/), examines the history of the National Monument. 

We examine the competing interpretations of Custer and the Battle of Little Bighorn among Native peoples, Custer enthusiasts, and the National Park Service. Over time, individuals and groups remember the past in different ways and compete with one another to shape the dominant public memory of an event or a place. Often these disparate interpretations become entangled with conversations about identity and society. 

The Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument has long been the focus of passionate debates and roundly criticized for its one‚Äêsided storytelling, encapsulated in its former name the _Custer Battlefield National Monument_. The constructed past at Little Bighorn has changed frequently since Little Bighorn. This essay examines the tangled process of making memory, landscape, and identity at the site of the Little Bighorn battlefield.
