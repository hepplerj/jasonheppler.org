  <p>Behind the scenes at Buffalo Bill's Wild West.</p>

  <div class="intro">
	<p>The Lakota referred to themselves as <em>oskate wicasa</em>, or
	"one who performs." Hundreds worked for Buffalo Bill between 1883
	and 1917. They traveled the world, earned good wages, and
	participated in cultural practices otherwise discouraged on
	reservations in America.</p> </div>

	<p>Drawn primarily from the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota,
	Indians worked for Buffalo Bill's Wild West in large numbers. Both
	behind the scenes and in the arena, a remarkable and consistent
	level of sympathy for Native culture allowed American Indians the
	opportunity to preserve cultural practices. Yet in its own ways, the
	Wild West promoted a vision of Progressive reform.</p>

	<p>Between 1870 and 1920, Progressives developed a remarkably
	ambitious agenda that sought to control businesses, eliminate
	poverty, purify politics, and transform other Americans in their
	image. Progressive ideals had their roots among middle–class Gilded
	Age men and women who transformed their views of the individual,
	society, gender, and leisure between the end of the Civil War
	through the turn of the century. Progressives demanded social
	transformation through a broad array of settlement houses, churches,
	schools, courtrooms, and legislative halls. Progressives, however,
	were far from unified in their approach to a broad social
	agenda.</p>

      <p>For many Progressives, Buffalo Bill's Wild West was a source of
	  frustration. Assimilationist Progressives&#8212;religious or
	  government reformers&#8212;often approached the Progressive agenda
	  through common ways. Among Native Americans, Progressives sought
	  to force Native people to adopt reforms and eradicate their
	  traditional lifestyles. The image of Indians as "savage" and
	  "uncivilized" was commonly held among Assimilationist
	  Progressives. Autonomous Progressives, such as William F. Cody,
	  believed in the reformist ideals of Progressivism but differed in
	  his method. Rather than insist upon compulsory transformations,
	  Cody believed in enabling Indians to come to terms with modern
	  society on their own. Cody never discouraged tribal culture but
	  allowed Native peoples to continue cultural practices both in the
	  arena and behind the scenes. The differing ideologies and images
	  of Indians collided in the Wild West, most spectacularly in 1899
	  in a dispute between the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Wild
	  West. More than a battle over whose image of Indians would
	  prevail, the differing progressive ideologies surrounding the Wild
	  West illustrate strains of progressive reform and conflicts over
	  federal Indian policy.</p>

	  <p><em>William F. Cody and the Progressive Wild West</em> seeks to
			  examine Cody's attitudes towards American Indians and
			  present a scholarly argument in the digital form.</p>
