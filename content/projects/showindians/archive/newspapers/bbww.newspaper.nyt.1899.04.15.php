		<h1>INDIANS GUESTS OF HONOR.</h1>

		<h3>Mrs. Henry Bruton Entertains Three from the Wild West Show.</h3>

		<p>Indians in the somewhat incongruous surroundings of beautiful furniture, fine paintings, cut glass, silver, and charming women in beautiful gowns were a conspicuous feature at a breakfast given by Mrs. Henry Bruton at the Hotel Manhattan yesterday morning.  There were present <span title="NA: Members" style="background-color: transparent;">three Indians from the Wild West Show</span>, <span title="NA: Descriptions" style="background-color: transparent;">in their most elaborate attire, feather headdresses, bead jackets, beaded blankets, and beautiful armlets</span>.  The breakfast was given in their honor.  Mrs. Bruton has traveled extensively in Mexico and the West, and feels a peculiar interest in the red men, whom she has seen on their native soil.</p>

		<p>The breakfast was at 11 o'clock to suit the convenience of the guests.  The table was handsomely decorated.  there were quantities of flowers, and a bouquet for each Indian, besides trinkets of various kinds.  There were some twenty other guests present.  The guests of honor were <span title="NA: Members" style="background-color: transparent;">Mr. Sammy Lone Bear, Mr. Joe Black Fox, and Mr. Philip Standing Soldier</span>.  It may be said that <span title="Image: Civilization" style="background-color: transparent;">the manners of the three were unexceptional.  They ate with their forks at the table and carried themselves during the two hours' of their stay with dignified freedom</span>.<p>

		<p>Mrs. Bruton bought all the Indian trinkets the guests of honor had with them, to send to friends abroad.  A photographer was also present and took photographs of Mrs. Bruton and her guests, which will also go abroad.</p>
