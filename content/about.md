  <p class="u-lead"><strong>Hi! I'm Jason</strong>, a web developer by trade and a historian by vocation at the <a href="https://rrchnm.org/">Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media</a> (RRCHNM) at <a href="https://historyarthistory.gmu.edu">George Mason University</a>. I collaborate with faculty and graduate students on the innovative application of technology in teaching and research across interactive data visualization, design, and public and digital history. I hold a Ph.D. from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and currently split my time between Lincoln and Fairfax.</p>

  <p>(<a href="/bio/">Need a full bio?</a>)</p>

  <p>Because we live in an era of climate emergency, most of my work is concerned with land, water, and energy, and the history tied up within these: who controlled access to these things; how were these things owned and used; what stories do we tell about places and how does that shape what happened; how the landscape is a record of history and power; how state institutions shape thinking about landscape, nature, and health. In addition to my work in environmental history, I'm also a scholar with expertise in digital mapping, spatial history, statistics, and big-data / machine reading methods for historical research. I was formerly an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, but elected to leave the tenure track for the creative energy and cutting-edge research around RRCHNM. In addition, I am an Affiliate Fellow at the Center for Great Plains Studies at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.</p>
