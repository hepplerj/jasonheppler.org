> What worries me are the consequences of a diet comprised mostly of fake-connectedness, makebelieve insight, and unedited first drafts of everything. I think it’s making us small. I know that whenever I become aware of it, I realize how small it can make me. So, I’ve come to despise it.

I recently reread Merlin Mann's piece [Better](http://www.merlinmann.com/better) and much of it really resonated with me.

It's been a crazy year. I wrote an ebook on Ruby programming that received a lot of feedback. I started an alt-ac job working on the [Cody Archive](http://codyarchive.org) for [CDRH](http://cdrh.unl.edu). I completed my progress towards UNL's new Certificate in Digital Humanities. I adopted a second dog and have worked hard with both of them in training. In my personal life I've had both [profound sadness](https://twitter.com/#!/jaheppler/status/109114548174327809) and extreme happiness, both for myself and for those around me. 

There are other areas where I see a need to be better, to tune out the distractions, and focus on what's important. I'm walking away from half-finished, half-useful things I make and consume.

In other words, I'm becoming much pickier about where my attention goes. I enjoy connecting, sharing, finding similar interests. But I'm drawing a new line for myself. I'm cutting away things I no longer find useful. What matters is the hard work and personal connections I make, not the most recent meme on Reddit, some half-witted Twitter update, some design tweak on my blog, or imaginary achievements on XBox. 

So, my New Year pledges echo Merlin's:

- if it has a small return, remove it
- remove anything that is more noisy than useful
- be brutally honest about what I *don't* need to be doing
- avoid fakeness
- demand personal focus on making good things
- put a handful of real people at the center of everything

I want to [go be awesome](http://www.jasonheppler.org/go-be-awesome.html). I'm seizing back my time and attention from the noise and fakeness and want to show the world what I can make.
