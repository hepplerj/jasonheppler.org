In June 2006 the late Roy Rosenzweig <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/resources/essays/d/42" target="_blank">published</a> an article entitled "Can History be Open Source?  Wikipedia and the  Future of the Past" in the <em>Journal of American History</em>.  Open  source models like Wikipedia, Rosenzweig suggests, might offer  alternatives to the historian's highly individualistic and possessive  craft.  The triumph of Wikipedia indicates the thirst for free and  accessible information people have. The methods and approaches that have  characterized Wikipedia's success raises questions about how we  produce, share, and debate scholarly work.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Success-Open-Source-Steven-Weber/dp/0674018583/" target="_blank">Open source</a> in the technical sense means offering  software and code available for free, allowing users to explore, extend,  debug, or tweak in a highly collaborative atmosphere (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Access-Principle-Scholarship-Electronic-Publishing/dp/0262232421/" target="_blank">open access</a> refers to the principle of making  research freely available; for my purposes I tend to think of the two  together and often refer to them interchangeably - for instance,  offering the raw <a href="http://tdhxp.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/textual-analysis/" target="_self">XML</a> of a transcribed newspaper article on my digital  history project is both open source and open access by providing access  to my research and access to the data and encoding behind documents).   Open source began with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman" target="_blank">Richard  Stallman</a>, who voiced the idea of making computer code freely  available for all to use and edit as long as they shared changes to the  software.  In his wake came Linus Torvalds, the creator of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank">Linux</a>,  and Brian Behlendorf, the developer of the free web server package <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server" target="_blank">Apache</a>.

Although much of open source refers to software development, the  principle has entered academic debates over the nature of historical  research and scholarship.  Should <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/resources/essays/essay.php?id=2#_ednref3" target="_blank">historical scholarship be free</a>?  Do historians have  an obligation to reach scholarly and nonscholarly audiences alike?  Can  open source publishing achieve that goal?  The advantages are numerous.   Open source historical work becomes more visible, can be retrieved  easily, reach broader audiences, and have a greater impact.  Most junior  scholars will be lucky to have 100 copies of their book purchased by  libraries worldwide (try searching a newly published monograph on  WorldCat and see what comes up).  On the web, however, digital  scholarship has the potential of reaching thousands of readers in search  of historical material.  We can also track usage on websites and  determine what people are reading and using in digital projects, a task  that cannot be done with a printed book (how many readers out there have  unread books sitting on their shelves?  The purchase of a book doesn't  necessarily mean the information within is being distributed as the  author would like).  It is in the interest of professional historians to  provide ungated, open access to their work, because doing so increases  readership and recognition.  Open access means instantaneous access to  research, the ability to correct errors almost immediately, and a  radical democratization of knowledge production.

Does this mean we will write free, open source historical  scholarship?  Bill Turkel is pioneering this effort with the publication  of <em><a href="http://programminghistorian.org/" target="_blank">The Programming Historian</a></em>, an open-access  introduction to programming for historians with little prior programming  experience.  There are some real challenges for an open access model,  the least of which being the business models currently in place among  scholarly societies.  The challenge for them is that there would be  little use for large, subscription-based archives like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSTOR" target="_blank">JSTOR</a> if scholarship and research is released online for free.  However,  solutions exist for fixing such a problem (as Rosenzweig <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/resources/essays/essay.php?id=2#_ednref7" target="_blank">outlines</a>).  Historians and scholarly societies  should start looking at these issues and developing ideas and business  models that will work for open access archives, scholarship, and  publishing.  If our purpose is to share with others what we know and  have learn about the past, then democratic access to scholarship should  be our ultimate goal as historians.  Digital technology gives us the  tools to rethink the presentation and dissemination of historical  scholarship.  Although challenges and questions exist, that should not  deter historians from embracing open source historical scholarship and  sharing knowledge.  "If historians believe that what is available free  on the Web is low quality," Rosenzweig <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/resources/essays/d/42" target="_blank">writes</a>,  "then we have a reponsiblity to make better information sources  available online."
