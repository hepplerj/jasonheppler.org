Recently on Boing Boing, Cory Doctorow pointed to [this quote](http://boingboing.net/2011/06/29/why-writers-should-h.html) from John Scalzi arguing that writers needed to register their own domain rather than use Facebook:

> So, let's go back to 1998. You're a new writer and you want to establish a permanent residency online. Which would be wiser: Having your own site at your own domain, or putting up a site at GeoCities?
It's 2001, same drill: Which is wiser: Having your own domain, or creating a site on AOL servers?

> 2003: Your own domain, or a Friendster page?

> 2007: Your own domain, or a MySpace page?

> (Hindsight is a useful thing.)

> And now it's 2011 and the choice is one's own domain or a page on Facebook. Guess which I think you should do.

Even worse is the strange trend of people deciding that Google+ makes for a [good blogging and identity platform](http://marshallk.com/why-ill-never-redirect-my-personal-blog-to-google-plus).

I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/#!/jaheppler/status/86110158928887808) that this holds true for scholars, creative professionals, knowledge workers, and anyone else that requires an online presence (are there any areas of our economy and society where you *shouldn't* have an online identity?). The problem with proprietary networks like Facebook and Google+ is they want to hold your content, which works against the durability, quality, and sustainability of your online identity.

Refuse to give up control over your identity. [Own it](http://www.marco.org/2011/07/11/own-your-identity).
