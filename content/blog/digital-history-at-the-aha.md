I'm excited to be attending the American Historical Association meeting in Chicago, not only because it is my first AHA but also because of the great number of sessions on Digital History. Kaci Nash, Leslie Working, and myself will be blogging at [The Digital History Project blog](https://digitalhistory.wordpress.com/) summarizing as many of the sessions as we can at the end of each day. We will also be live tweeting from as many as we can. You can follow tweets about the AHA with [#AHA2012](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23aha2012).

[THATcamp AHA](http://aha2012.thatcamp.org/) is meeting today as well, which I'll be participating in. I'm also in the AHA program and will be [participating in a round table](http://aha.confex.com/aha/2012/webprogram/Session6779.html) on Sunday morning. I look forward to meeting a lot of new people, connecting with some long-time Twitter followers, and overall having a great time in Chicago.
