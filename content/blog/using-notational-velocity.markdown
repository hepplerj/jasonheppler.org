One of my favorite Mac programs is [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/). I do a lot of writing with it -- everything from meeting notes, to jotting down ideas, to creating reference files and running lists, even occasionally to write up longer-form content like blog posts or research (though I tend to use TextMate for most long-form writing). 

Notational Velocity (or the fork I use, [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/)) follows the [One Thing Well](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) philosophy:

* It's lightweight.
* It allows you to just write no frills text.
* Text is saved automatically.
* Text can be found very simply through the built-in progressive search.

The entire system makes it very easy to focus on writing. You don't need to click "New File" or anything else -- simply type in the new file you'd like to create and hit Return and you're ready to go. You never have to use the mouse, even; just hit Cmd-L and your cursor is placed in the location bar. Type in your file, press Return, and start writing.

### My Setup ###

My setup is pretty simple. Here a few things I've done with my setup:

1. Under Preferences, I've set up Notational Velocity to store everything as plain text files. Plain text, after all, is [the most portable, the most searchable, the most light weight medium for your writing](http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2011/07/21/word-internet/). I can work on my writing on my laptop, or access the files on my phone if I need to.
2. I use to have the system synchronize with Simplenote, but I've turned this feature off recently. Instead, I have all of my notes synchronized to Dropbox. Everything is backed up and with me where ever I have an internet connection.

### Usage ###

Now here comes the geeky side of things. My system is very similar to the [system used by Merlin Mann](http://macpowerusers.com/2011/03/mpu-046-workflows-with-merlin-mann-ii/):

1. All of my notes are appended with, for lack of a better word, "tags" that I use to group items together and reference things quickly. For example, my blog post brainstorms or drafts are prefixed with "blogx" followed by a potential post title and finally I use a TextExpander snippet to insert the full date and time (for example, a Notational line for this post might look like "blogx jahx Using Notational Velocity 2011-07-22_23-05-06"). Like Merlin, I use the "x" at the end of my prefixes to quickly find things. I want to see all my blog material? I type "blogx". I want a list of my running lists? I search for "runx". Some of these are narrowed down: blogx is usually followed by "jahx" (my initials, a post meant for this site) or "tcx" (a blog post for Tumblr). 
2. For frequently used items I use [Merlin Mann's "q trick"](http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/453204090/q-trick). If I have a file I reference frequently or want to locate quickly, I follow it with a number of q's, starting with at least two and usually going up to five. For example, I have a file called "TODAY agenda [qqqqq]" that I store my "most important things" to-do list in of things I want to accomplish that day. It's faster to type multiple q's rather than start searching for the individual file. 
3. I may draft up ideas for blog posts or research projects in Notational Velocity, but I normally do most of my writing in TextMate. I like the feel of TextMate, and it also just does One Thing Well.
4. There's nothing that *doesn't* go into Notational Velocity. I currently have around 270 text files in Notational Velocity, sometimes nothing more than a single line of text. I frequently dump often-used snippets into Notational and are titled with a "refx" prefix (like an HTML snippet or command line function like the one I use to convert markdown to PDF; if used often enough these become snippets in TextExpander).

The point of all this crazy taxonomy is to allow me to *not have to think very hard about what I'm after*. I want to find what I'm looking for immediately, without having to waste a lot of time searching the back of my brain with the half-remembered thought. Nor do I want to always fire up a browser and search for what I'm looking for. If I've found a method that works and that requires a reference or running list or whatever, it goes into Notational for future reference.

The additional advantage to this system is it isn't tied to a specific computer platform. If I left the Mac operating system for Linux, for example, I still have all of my plaintext files that I can easily still write in or search through the command line or an equivalent program in Linux. I also like having everything with me in Dropbox where ever I'm at. If I'm waiting at a doctor's appointment, standing in line at the store, or just killing some time, I can pull up my files and find something to work on or scratch out an idea.

Finally, everything is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Whether I'm working in Notational Velocity, [Epistle](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.kooklab.epistle), TextMate, or Scrivener, Markdown is my preferred plain text writing syntax.
