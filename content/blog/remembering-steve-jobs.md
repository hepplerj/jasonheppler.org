Tim Cook's <a

> Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.

I'm saddened to hear of Steve Jobs' passing. Perhaps I'm feeling especially close to it because of personal events that [transpired in the last month](https://twitter.com/#!/jaheppler/status/109114548174327809), but I'm also deeply connected to Steve's company and its products, which are embedded in my career, hobbies, and personal life. Steve Jobs was an inspiration to do great things, and his vision for technology and energy he brought to his work has certainly inspired me.
