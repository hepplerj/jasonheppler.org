Be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.journalofamericanhistory.org/issues/952/index.html">September  2008</a> issue of the<em> <a href="http://www.journalofamericanhistory.org/">Journal of American  History</a> </em>that includes an exchange between the leading digital  historians of the field -- <a href="http://digitalhistoryhacks.blogspot.com/">Bill Turkel</a>,  Will Thomas, <a href="http://www.dancohen.org/">Dan Cohen</a>, Amy Murrell, Patrick  Callagher, Michael Frisch, Kristen Sword, and Steve Mintz.  It's a great  introduction to the field and explores the possibilities of the digital  age for research, communication, and teaching.  The <a href="http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jah/95.2/interchange.html">article  is online</a> at the <a href="http://www.historycooperative.org/">History Cooperative</a> (unfortunately its gated -- hopefully the JAH will make the article  freely available).

Also, let me apologize for the very light posting and slow start the  blog has gotten thus far.  Hopefully Brent and I can pick things up this  semester.  We're both embarking upon our own digital history projects,  so I'm sure thoughts about the process, challenges, and rewards of a  digital history site will be shared in this space.

Furthermore, several of us will be attending the <a href="http://www.umsl.edu/~wha/">Western  Historical Association Conference</a> in October in Salt Lake City,  which is featuring a panel on digital history with our colleagues (and  gracious comments by Richard White).  Either Brent or I will be  liveblogging that panel, so be sure to tune in and check it out.
