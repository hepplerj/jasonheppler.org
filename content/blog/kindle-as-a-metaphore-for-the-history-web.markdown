Amazon is featuring on its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">main  page</a> that the Kindle is shipping right away after months of being  back ordered because of insufficient production to meet the demand.  Also, they’ve published their <a href="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/digital/fiona/general/2007letter.pdf">letter  to shareholders</a> (PDF alert), which focuses almost exclusively on  the Kindle. Reading the letter, it sounds like Jeff Bezos has some big  plans for going completely electronic.  More below the jump.

Last week, Julia Keller of the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/chi-0420_bookfutureapr20,0,7892327.column">wondered</a> about the future of books in our Internet age. In her estimation,  tangible books have little to fear in the future. She reports that  book sales since 2007 have increased 3.2 percent over 2006, and the book  business has seen a growth rate of 2.5 percent per year since 2002. I think she's right and that books have little to fear in our digital age. Indeed, Bezos writes in the letter to shareholders that Amazon isn't  trying to destroy the book, but to make them available in a new medium  and offer features that cannot be replicated in physical books:
<blockquote><em>Instead of trying to duplicate  physical bookstores, we’ve been inspired by them and worked to find  things we could do in the new medium that could never be done in the old  one. We don’t have electronic book signings, and similarly we can’t  provide a comfortable spot to sip coffee and relax. However, we can  offer literally millions of titles, help with purchase decisions through  customer reviews, and provide discovery features like “customers who  bought this item also bought.” The list of useful things that can be  done only in the new medium is a long one.</em></blockquote>
I'm not so concerned about the merits of Kindle at  present.  Rather, what Bezos has done with the book -- creating a useful  tool with many new features that make it easier for readers to access  information -- can similarly be applied to digital history.  For one,  digitization is changing the way we can approach research.  Few have  owned a microfilm reader in their office or home, but scholars can now  turn to Google to begin early inquiries of their work.  I'm presently  sitting in a coffee shop (ostensibly) working on a paper.  With the free  WiFi provided by the coffee shop, my laptop can tell me a wealth of  information in an instant.  I can examine Civil War documents at the <a href="http://valley.vcdh.virginia.edu/">Valley of the Shadow</a>,  read Martin Luther King Jr's <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ybwUfb7CSVcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=subject:%22+Political+Science+%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;rview=1&amp;sig=pcMvJKDpvfvnPvDdhs2PED58PAE"><em>Why  We Can't Wait</em></a>, organize, categorize, and tag bookmarks on <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.ic.ious</a>,  or even locate and categorize photos for class on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>.   A variety of other tools help historians confront the web in their  quest for information: databases, search engines, XML, RSS feeds, or  tools like the inestimable<a href="http://www.zotero.org/"> Zotero</a> interact with a variety of  information retrieval systems to provide a steady stream of  information.  In an ever-growing online environment, it is important for  historians to make sense of historical material.  (See Prof. Turkel's  thoughts on researching online in his post entitled "<a href="http://digitalhistoryhacks.blogspot.com/2008/01/search-comes-first.html">The  Search Comes First</a>."  While you're at it, ask him about his new  book!)

What does digitization mean for the craft of  history?  To an extent, digitization, whether it be digital books,  archives, scholarship, or blogs, is the great <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/resources/essays/d/42">democratizer</a> of  the web and adds a layer of transparency to our craft.  For example,  Douglas Feith's new book, <a href="http://www.waranddecision.com/"><em>War and Decision</em></a>,  includes a <a href="http://www.waranddecision.com/">companion website</a> that  provides links to 600 documents in his cited work.  Readers are free to  probe the sources Feith used to write his monograph, which is an example  of what academic historians can do with online history. However,  Feith's website is a rudimentary form of what we can do with the history  web.  More importantly, the web offers tools historians can use to  analyze material in new ways and present to our readers.   Constructing <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/">timelines</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud">word clouds</a> for  textual analysis provides visual representations of historical  scholarship and can alter the questions we ask about the past.  Tools  like <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> allows us to "fly"  over the terrain Alexander the Great encountered at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halicarnassus">Siege of  Halicarnassus</a>.  It is one thing to view the land on a flat map, and  quite another to have an on-the-ground view of the hilly coastal  landscape Alexander and his men dealt with.  <a href="http://digitalhistoryhacks.blogspot.com/2006/09/natures-metropolis-and-its-hinterland.html">Imagine</a> what <a href="http://www.williamcronon.net/">William Cronon</a> could have  done with Google Earth . . .

Tying these ideas together is interactivity.    Users of digital scholarship are not only presented with our historical  arguments, but are free to explore sources and drawn their own  connections.  Incorporating hypertext into our narratives allows readers  to freely explore related topics and indulge their curiosities --  perhaps a close culmination of the skip trails envisioned by <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/194507/bush">Vannevar Bush</a>.   Dynamic maps like those used by <a href="http://www.texasslaveryproject.org/">Andrew Torget</a> allow  us to visualize changes in the past; in Torget's case it's the spread of  slavery into Texas.  Such tools change the way historians analyze data  and raise questions.  Furthermore, the web is not just a vehicle for  entertainment but increasingly is a tool for education.  Often people  turn to the Internet or Wikipedia (the family encyclopedia for the  twenty-first century) and go no further.  Historians need to take a role  in defining the history web and ensuring adequate information exists  for other scholars, students, and general readers.  Are there problems?   Absolutely.  It's unsure if Internet-based reading will take off among  the general public.  Yet, with more and more grade-school children going  through school systems that depend on computers, electronic reading in  the future may come as naturally as reading a dead-tree copy of the <em>New  York Times</em> (I admit I haven't made the complete shift to electronic  newspapers yet).  Additionally, online scholarship has the potential to  reach a far greater number of readers than our academic books.  There  are also issues with tenure and promotion -- simply, no standards exist  exist.  The OAH and AHA have yet to define peer review or professional  standards for digital scholarship, which effectively tells historians to  not consider the medium since it lacks a reward system.  (I imagine  these issues will be taken up in future blog posts by either Brent or  myself -- my list of blog topic ideas is getting quite long).

Kindle will not replace the book, and nor will  digital history.  Digital scholarship is not meant to replicate print  culture. If that were the goal of digital scholarship, then there would  be no purpose.  That process was already attempted with e-books and  failed.  Digital historians are not challenging institutions just to  challenge them, but we're coming to this as scholars or burgeoning  scholars and asking the profession to consider these tools and ideas.   Like Kindle, we're trying to find ways to do things in the new medium  that cannot be replicated in the old.
