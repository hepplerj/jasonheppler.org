[Gabe Weatherhead](http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/11/omnifocus-workflow-and-notes-link.html) points to Sean Korzdorfer's [great outline on how he uses OmniFocus and notes](http://www.seankorzdorfer.com/open_notebook/omnifocus%20work%20flow%20and%20notes.html). I was particularly interested in his time-based contexts:

> Morning – A bucket for tasks best done first thing in the morning. Usually coding or technical writing.
> Start Time: 06:00.
> 
> Afternoon – A bucket for tasks best done when I'm starting to get tired, burnt out or stupid. Usually research and administrative tasks.
> Start Time: 13:00.
> 
> Evening – A bucket for family or personal project tasks that I can complete while half asleep.
> Start Time: 17:00.

My OmniFocus contexts take on a [Merlin Mann level of granularity](http://5by5.tv/mpu/91), and I've also been heavily inspired by Kourosh Dini's advice in *[Creating Flow with OmniFocus](http://www.usingomnifocus.com/)*. Here's just a snippet of my contexts:

But I'm particularly interested in the idea because I operate in a similar way: depending on the time of day I'm better suited for certain tasks. At one point in [my pre-OmniFocus days](http://todotxt.com/) I was using a similar system with contexts that were based on energy levels (e.g., "dashes," "brain dead," "focus," and so on). Korzdorfer's contexts worth considering the next moment I take the time to revisit my tasks.
