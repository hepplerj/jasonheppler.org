[Horace Greeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Greeley) once called upon Americans to "go West!" Well, I'm not fulfilling anyone's Manifest Destiny, but I am going (further) West. I am pleased to announce that I have accepted a position as the [Academic Technology Specialist](http://acomp.stanford.edu/faculty/atsp) in the History Department at Stanford University. I'll be stepping into the role in January and will be working with the department faculty and graduate students on some [cool projects](http://cesta.stanford.edu), act as a proponent for digital humanities in research and teaching, and serve as the technical expert in digital methods.

The decision comes with an array of emotions. I've been at the University of Nebraska since 2007 and have had the opportunity to create and work on amazing digital projects, collaborate with the smartest people I've ever met, and make wonderful and lifelong friends. Everything I've learned about digital humanities I learned at UNL and from colleagues at the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities. I'm sad to be leaving, but I'm also excited that I'll get to continue doing the work I love at a place where a lot of exciting work is being done. 

The job is a true alt-ac position, and many people -- whether they know it or not -- have convinced me that an alt-ac job was something I wanted to pursue. [Brian Croxall](http://www.briancroxall.net), [Jeremy Boggs](http://clioweb.org), [Bethany Nowviskie](http://nowviskie.org), [Miriam Posner](http://www.miriamposner.com), and many others have walked down this path with great success, and they're exemplars as I step into this position.

I have a lot of professional and personal work to do in the next few months, but I'm excited about what lay ahead.
