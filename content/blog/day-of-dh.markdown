Tomorrow, I'll be blogging <a href="http://ra.tapor.ualberta.ca/~dayofdh2011/jasonheppler/">here</a> for <a href="http://tapor.ualberta.ca/taporwiki/index.php/Day_in_the_Life_of_the_Digital_Humanities_2011">Day of DH 2011</a>. You can also follow along on Twitter through the hashtag <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23dayofdh">#dayofdh</a>. What is Day of DH, you ask? Well, as Steve Ramsay <a href="http://lenz.unl.edu/wordpress/?p=177">noted</a> last year, "we do it mainly to demonstrate to other scholarly communities that we have way more fun than they do."
