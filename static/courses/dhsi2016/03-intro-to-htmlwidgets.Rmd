## htmlwidgets

An R package for integrating JavaScript libraries into R visualizations. Visualizations can appear in RMarkdown documents, RStudio, or Shiny web applications (more on this on Day 4).

You can find the full documentation for `htmlwidgets` at <http://www.htmlwidgets.org>.

## htmlwidgets

There are many widgets available for building interactive graphics:

- `networkD3`: force directed networks, Sankey diagrams, tree networks
- `edgebundleR`: hierarchical edge bundle plots
- `pairsD3`: interactive scatterplot matrices
- `dygraphs`: charting time-series data
- `leaflet`: dynamic maps
- `DT`: interactive data tables
- `rpivotTables`: build pivot tables to dynamically slice and plot data

## Why htmlwidgets?

- Works relatively well without an Internet connection (once you've downloaded the package)
- Customization (sometimes)
- Active community of users and creators
    - Some people are [extremely active](http://www.buildingwidgets.com/blog) -- building one htmlwidget a week
- If you want to make your own, some [good documentation]() on how to create, including D3 examples.

## htmlwidgets - Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# from CRAN
install.packages("htmlwidgets")

# or the development version
devtools::install_github("ramnathv/htmlwidgets")

library(htmlwidgets)
```

## Specific Widgets

You don't necessarily need the entire `htmlwidgets` package. We can call upon specific packages:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# time series charts
devtools::install_github("rstudio/dygraphs")

# interactive data tables
devtools::install_github("rstudio/DT")

# leaflet maps
devtools::install_github("rstudio/leaflet")
```

## Plotly

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("plotly")
```

A package for leveraging the [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/) library API. 

- Build browser-based charts and graphics
- Works locally in the HTML widgets framework
- Provides standard events to work across plot types
- Easy to hook events into Shiny apps
- And the best news:

## Let's start with what we know

Let's use this weather data on San Francisco.

```{r}
# install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
sf_weather <- read_csv("http://bl.ocks.org/bricedev/raw/458a01917183d98dff3c/sf.csv")

# We'll make the variable names easier to work with
names(sf_weather) <- names(sf_weather) %>% 
  str_to_lower() %>% 
  str_replace("\\s+", "_")

# We only want a couple columns
sf_weather <- sf_weather %>% 
  select(date, max_temperaturec, min_temperaturec)
```

## {.fullscreen}

```{r}
sf_weather
```

## Plotly

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = sf_weather, 
            aes(x = date, y = min_temperaturec), 
            color = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, "Set1")[2]) +
  geom_line(data = sf_weather, 
            aes(x = date, y = max_temperaturec), 
            color = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, "Set1")[1]) +
    labs(title = "San Francisco Weather, 2014-2015",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Minimum and Maxium Temperature (C)") +
  theme_jah() #ignore: my custom theming
```

## {.fullscreen}

```{r, echo=F}
ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = sf_weather, 
            aes(x = date, y = min_temperaturec), 
            color = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, "Set1")[2]) +
  geom_line(data = sf_weather, 
            aes(x = date, y = max_temperaturec), 
            color = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, "Set1")[1]) +
    labs(title = "San Francisco Weather, 2014-2015",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Minimum and Maxium Temperature (C)") +
  theme_jah() #ignore: my custom theming
```

## Plotly

```{r, eval=F}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("ropensci/plotly")
```

For reference, the `ggplot2` and `plotly` documentation: <https://plot.ly/ggplot2/>

## Plotly

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = sf_weather, 
            aes(x = date, y = min_temperaturec), 
            color = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, "Set1")[2]) +
  geom_line(data = sf_weather, 
            aes(x = date, y = max_temperaturec), 
            color = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, "Set1")[1]) +
    labs(title = "San Francisco Weather, 2014-2015",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Minimum and Maxium Temperature (C)") +
  theme_jah() #ignore: my custom theming
```

## Plotly

```{r, eval=F}
viz <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = sf_weather, 
            aes(x = date, y = min_temperaturec), 
            color = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, "Set1")[2]) +
  geom_line(data = sf_weather, 
            aes(x = date, y = max_temperaturec), 
            color = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, "Set1")[1]) +
    labs(title = "San Francisco Weather, 2014-2015",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Minimum and Maxium Temperature (C)") +
  theme_jah() #ignore: my custom theming
```

## Plotly

All we need is to call `ggplotly` and pass our `viz` variable as an argument.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplotly(viz)
```

## ... and much more

```{r}
plot_ly(z = volcano, type = "surface")
```

## Interactive Network Visualization

htmlwidgets comes with a few options

- networkD3: using the `D3.js` JavaScript library
- visNetwork: using the `vis.js` JavaScript library

## networkD3

![D3js](assets/img/d3js.png)

## networkD3

Let's say we want to exame a character network from *Les Miserables*.

```{r}
data(MisLinks, MisNodes)
MisLinks %>% head(5)
MisNodes %>% head(5)
```

## networkD3

```{r}
library(networkD3)
forceNetwork(Links = MisLinks, Nodes = MisNodes,
             Source = "source", Target = "target", 
             NodeID = "name", # label nodes
             Group = "group", # color nodes by group, calculated earlier
             charge = -70, # node repulsion
             linkDistance = 25, # distance between any two connected nodes
             zoom = T, 
             opacity = 0.8)
```

## networkD3 - Modifying with D3.js

```{r}
# with a simple click action - make the circles bigger when clicked
node_size_on_click <- 
  ' d3.select(this).select("circle")
      .transition().duration(750)
      .attr("r", 40)'

forceNetwork(Links = MisLinks, Nodes = MisNodes, Source = "source",
             Target = "target", Value = "value", NodeID = "name",
             Group = "group", opacity = 1, zoom = T, fontSize=24,
             clickAction = node_size_on_click)
```

> There is a tendency when using graphs to become smitten with one's own data. Even though a graph of a few hundred nodes quickly becomes **unreadable**, it is often satisfying for the creator because the resulting figure is **elegant** and **complex** and may be subjectively beautiful, and the notion that the creator's data is "complex" fits just fine with the creator's own interpretation of it. **Graphs have a tendency of making a data set look sophisticated and important, without having solved the problem of enlightening the viewer.**
