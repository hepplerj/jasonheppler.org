<h2 intro="">Hi. I'm Jason.</h2>

<p>I'm a writer, historian, hacker-scholar, and tech enthusiast. I grew up in South Dakota and currently live in Lincoln, Nebraska, with my wife and our two dogs.</p>

<p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate in <a href="http://history.unl.edu">History</a> at the <a href="www.unl.edu">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a> specializing in the North American West, 20th century United States, and digital history. My dissertation research is on the Cold War American West, urban change, and digital computers as it centered around the military-industrial-academic complex in the region.</p>

<p>In January 2011 I became project manager for the <a href="www.codyarchive.org">William F. Cody Digital Archive</a> at the <a href="http://cdrh.unl.edu">Center for Digital Research in the Humanities</a> on the campus of UNL. Through a multi-institutional partnership, the Cody Archive seeks to contextualizes the life and times of William F. "Buffalo Bill" Cody.</p>

<p>Prior to joining CDRH I served as both research and teaching assistant for the History Department. I worked on or created several projects, including <a href="http://digitalhistory.unl.edu">The Digital History Project</a>, <a ref="railroads.unl.edu">Railroads and the Making of Modern America</a>, <a href="http://buffalobillproject.unl.edu">The Buffalo Bill Project</a>, <a href="http://segonku.unl.edu/~jheppler/showindian/">Buffalo Bill's Wild West and the Progressive Image of American Indians</a>, and <a href="http://framingredpower.org">Framing Red Power</a>. More academic information can be found in my <a href="http://cv.jasonheppler.org">curriculum vitae</a>.</p>

<p>As a bit of a hobby, I am interested in programming and the history of programming languages. In 2011 I wrote an ebook called <a href="http://hepplerj.github.com/rubyist-historian/">The Rubyist Historian</a> that intended to introduce humanities scholars to the basics of the Ruby programming language and its application to their everyday work. I am currently working on porting <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/">The Programming Historian</a> over to Ruby.</p>

<p>Outside of technology, my interests are music, geeking out over coffee, and playing guitar. In my free time I read fiction and watch films. My music interests range from bebop jazz to indie rock. Politically, I am similar to The Economist: mildly libertarian, socially liberal, fiscally conservative, cautiously globalist. I believe in open access and hold that all publically-funded research should automatically be available for free to the public. I have a strong interest in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada">Theravada Buddhism</a> and <a href="http://www.vipassana.com/meditation/mindfulness_in_plain_english_5.php">Vipassana meditation</a> (although I do not consider myself a Buddhist yet). </p>

<h2>About Here</h2>

<p>I write on a range of topics. Although I generally write on digital history and technology, my posts range from culture, music, coffee, ideas, and anything else that strikes me. There is no schedule or length that I seek to meet.</p>

<p>The site originally ran on WordPress but moved to <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> for static blogging in early 2011. My posts are now version controlled with git. Most of my writing and coding happens in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> on my MacBook Pro. The design of this site has changed frequently, mainly because I enjoy tinkering. Right now, the site design is borrowed from <a href="http://al3x.net/">Alex Payne</a>.</p>
