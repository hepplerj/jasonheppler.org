> If you had any doubts about whether you should publish through a traditional publisher, or take your destiny in your own hands and do it yourself (as I have happily done), today’s news should calm any fears that it’s a “real” option.

> According to Wired Magazine, JK Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series of books (which, as of yesterday, had no sign of ever hitting the eBook market), has decided to skip her publishers and release the 7-book series on her own in digital format. If you need help processing the news, let me help; this is huge.
