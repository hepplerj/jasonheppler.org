[Steven Burg notes that digital history training is becoming more common](http://publichistorycommons.org/the-future-is-here-public-history-education-and-the-rise-of-digital-history/) among public history programs:

> Almost two-thirds (64.5%) of the responding program directors reported that graduates of their programs would be leaving with competency in digital history and new media. Fifty-nine percent of public history program directors indicated that content on digital history and new media had been integrated into existing courses, and fully 46.2% stated that their programs had added one or more new courses on the study of new media or digital history. The directors also reported that more than one-third of public history programs are preparing their students to create or author digital history or new media resources (35.9%).
