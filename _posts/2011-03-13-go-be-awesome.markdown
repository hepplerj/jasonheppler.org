[Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford Commencement Address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc).

> No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.

> . . .

> Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice, heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.

Don't wait -- life isn't going to wait, the universe isn't going to wait. <em>Care</em> -- care about making, doing, creating, hustling.
