[Mark Sample](http://www.samplereality.com/2011/05/25/the-digital-humanities-is-not-about-building-its-about-sharing/):

> The promise of the digital is not in the way it allows us to ask new questions because of digital tools or because of new methodologies made possible by those tools. The promise is in the way the digital reshapes the representation, sharing, and discussion of knowledge. We are no longer bound by the physical demands of printed books and paper journals, no longer constrained by production costs and distribution friction, no longer hampered by a top-down and unsustainable business model. And we should no longer be content to make our work public achingly slowly along ingrained routes, authors and readers alike delayed by innumerable gateways limiting knowledge production and sharing.

Compare this with [Stephen Ramsay's argument](http://lenz.unl.edu/papers/2011/01/11/on-building.html) about building in the humanities and [William Thomas' post](http://railroads.unl.edu/blog/?p=454) on cyberargument in digital humanities.
