Ars Technica:

> The map, built on its Crisis Response platform, is tracking about 50 fires, including the 100,000-acre Clay complex in Utah and the dangerous Waldo Canyon fire that is threatening the city of Colorado Springs. The map tracks the fires themselves, including their extent, information on suppression efforts, evacuation status, and the locations of shelters.
> 
> Google has pulled together data on fire perimeters from the US Geological Survey and InciWeb, shelter information from the Red Cross, satellite info from DigitalGlobe, and fire weather information from NOAA's Storm Prediction Center. Local-level data has been drawn from the State of Colorado Division of Emergency Management, Utah Division of Emergency Management, and other sources. This information has been plotted in layers across Google Maps and Google Earth.
