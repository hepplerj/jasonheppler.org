The subnotebook - or "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook" target="_blank">netbook</a>"  - has become a hot gadget in the last year.  With the introduction of  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_PC" target="_blank">Asus  Eee PC</a> just over a year ago, the market for budget notebooks has  exploded.  The first Asus Eee boasted a two-pound, 7 inch screen  starting at under $300, an attractive price compared to the  "ultra-portable" laptops that often ran above $1,000.  Dell joined the  netbook frenzy in October 2008, releasing the <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop-inspiron-9?cs=19&amp;s=dhs&amp;ref=homepg" target="_blank">Dell Mini 9</a> for $349 (Linux) or $399 (Windows XP).

The system comes standard with 1.6GHz Intel Atom N270, 512MB of RAM,  and a 4GB solid state drive, making it a very basic computing machine.  I  made some upgrades to the memory (going with 1GB) and the hard drive  (going with 8GB).  Being a fan of open source and a user of Linux on my  previous laptop, I opted for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu" target="_blank">Linux  Ubuntu 8.04</a>.  Ubuntu comes with all the gear I would need for my  basic day to day tasks: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Office" target="_blank">OpenOffice  Suite</a> for word processing (alternatively I often use <a href="http://docs.google.com" target="_blank">Google Docs</a> for taking notes when I have access to  wireless Internet), <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> web browser (which I customized with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843" target="_blank">Firebug</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60" target="_blank">Web Developer</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865" target="_blank">AdBlock</a>, and <a href="http://www.zotero.org/" target="_blank">Zotero</a>), and media  software for playing audio or viewing videos.  My only other addition  has been <a href="http://www.jungledisk.com/" target="_blank">JungleDisk</a> so I  have access to my <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 server</a>.

Battery life thus far has been fantastic.  Installed with a four-cell  battery, Linux estimates I can get nearly four and a half hours of life  out of it (I suspect the number is actually closer to three and a half,  but thats a far cry better than the one and a half hours I might get  from my prior machine).

As the title suggests, this thing is tiny.  The computer is just over  an inch thick (1.07") and weighs just over two pounds.  It's roughly  the size of a book, and riding in my bag I would never know I had a  computer with me.  The compact size makes trips to class, the library,  the office, and archives a snap.  The display (1024 by 600 resolution)  is sharp and clear.

In terms of hardware, the netbook comes standard with three USB 2.0  ports, VGA, Ethernet, and headphone and microphone jacks.  It also comes  with a 4-in-1 memory card reader.

Now perhaps the most important part for historians:  the keyboard.   The keyboard might be less cramped than an Asus Eee's keyboard, but it  is still very compact.  Most of the alphanumeric keys are easy enough to  use and drafting a document is fairly painless.  However, the Tab,  Shift, and Caps key have been shrunk down or placed in unfamiliar  spots.  The most frustrating relocated key has been the  apostrophe/double quote key.  I find myself often hitting Enter instead  (the normal position of the apostrophe key on a QWERTY keyboard is next  to Enter), which can be quite irritating.  I've been able to retain  touch typing rather than hunt-and-peck for the most part, but its been  an exercise in retraining my brain to recall some of the new  placements.  This computer isn't designed to replace a main computer.   If you have thoughts about using this as your main computer, I recommend  picking up a full-size keyboard, wireless mouse, and external monitor.   The keyboard construction, however, is well built.  There's little flex  in the keyboard as you type and the keys are responsive.

The touchpad is decently sized, has a good textured feel to it, has  great sensitivity and response, and can easily naviage the desktop.  Two  mouse buttons are located below the touchpad.

If the machine is reserved to word processing, surfing the web, or  checking email, the Dell Mini 9 is a great machine.  As a portable tool  for research, taking notes, or PowerPoint, coupled with its nice  pricetag and ease of use, it would be hard to go wrong.
