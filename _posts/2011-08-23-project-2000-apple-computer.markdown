In 1987 Apple Computer sponsored a competition called [Project 2000](http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/articles/computing/88-academic/1/text.html). Apple challenged student design teams to submit designs of what computing technology looked like in 2000. In 1988 Apple produced a video illustrating the features and technologies that Apple saw just around the corner. The video doesn't showcase the winning tablet design or students (a team from the University of Illinois wrote a paper called [Tablet: The Personal Computer of the Year 2000](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19880008883_1988008883.pdf)) but the video hears from the judges on the panel, including Steve Wozniak, Alvin Toffler, Alan Kay, Diane Ravitch, and Ray Bradbury.
