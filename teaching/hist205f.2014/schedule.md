title: Schedule
...

Since we're spending three hours together once a week, I've set up the
schedule into "halves" for each class. We'll meet for roughly an hour and a
half, take a fifteen minute break, and reconvene for the remainder of the
class. The first half of the class will either revolve around a guest or
around reading discussion. The second half may vary with reading discussion,
tool discussion, or getting hands-on with a tool.

Note that readings are due on the date under which they are listed. For
example, on September 29 we are discussing digital archives, so you should
spend the week prior completing the readings, assignments, and prior-to-class
exercises.
